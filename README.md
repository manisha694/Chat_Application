COMPANY *: CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME : SATYAM MAURYA

INTERN ID : CT08DH899

DOMAIN : FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT

DURATION : 8 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA_SANTHU

DESCRIPTION : This is a full-stack real-time chat application built with React, Node.js,
Socket.IO, and MongoDB, offering secure user authentication with JWT, profile management
with avatar uploads, and instant real-time messaging powered by Socket.IO. Users can share
images via Cloudinary, switch between multiple themes using DaisyUI, and see online/offline
statuses of their contacts. The frontend uses React with Vite, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, Zustand
for state management, React Router for navigation, and Axios for API requests, while the backend
runs on Node.js with Express, MongoDB with Mongoose, and bcrypt for password hashing.
The application ensures message history persistence, real-time updates, and a fully
responsive design, delivering a smooth and engaging chat experience across devices.
